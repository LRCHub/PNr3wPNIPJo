This night thickens almost vicious.
...and now I'm left stuck in the dark.
Who ripped this page out of the fucking book?
It feels as if I'm being torn apart at the seams.
Dry Heart; Desert Heart
Fill my lungs with the blood. Rainy days, it's
Always raining.
In fits of sing-song desperation my heart was erased a long time ago.
Gaze into my fevered eyes...
"I feel numb."
