you function like a tape machine that drives me up the wall.
spit your message out i'm tired of llstening.
when you try to answer me you soon run out of words
so our communication is superficial.
mayday oh mayday confusion on the line.
mayday oh mayday i'm still not getting through.
mayday oh mayday keep trying.
your intentions may be good but please don't interfere.
you demonstrate a lack of understanding.
and as the empty words bounce back from the corners of the room
i wonder if you've noticed something is missing.
mayday oh mayday
yoll're just a symbol of authority.
who's paid to put me in a category.
this conversation is upsetting me.
